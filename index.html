    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <h3 style="text-align:center">Short story</h3>
   <p class="wrapper"> As a kid, I developed an interest in coding while on a site called Social Neko where I could customize my profile with CSS however I wanted. That was the first time I'd experienced coding before. When I'd decided that coding is what i wanted to do when I grew up, I made a blog post on the site and was almost immediately shot down. An older kid told me I was too late and I should've started sooner. Crazy right? I was about 12 at the time. My interst in coding didn't last long after that.
<br>
<br>
    Now I'm happy that I've finally gotten my start as a student at Thinkful. So, If you're looking for your next developer and have an amazing team, don't hesitate to reach out to me! I'll be more than excited to work with you all.
